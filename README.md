### PROJECT TITLE: Islamic Family Food Hamper Distribution Optimization

Welcome to the repository for our Capstone project at Norquest College. This project aims to enhance the efficiency of food hamper distribution by the **Islamic Family** organization in Edmonton. By leveraging historical data and socio-economic factors, we identify areas with high or low demand to optimize service delivery.

### Problem Statement

The Islamic Family organization distributes food hampers across Edmonton. However, there are gaps in reaching certain communities due to fluctuating demand, lack of geographic visibility, and socio-economic variability. Thereâ€™s a need for data-driven decision-making to better target outreach and resources.

### Solution

- Conducted data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Analyzed historical hamper distribution data and socio-economic indicators.
- Used visualization tools to identify trends and underserved regions.
- Proposed recommendations for mobile distribution points based on demand mapping.

###Methods
Key techniques include:

-Data cleaning and preprocessing.
-Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
-Correlation analysis between socio-economic indicators and hamper demand.
-Geographic heatmapping and clustering.
-Visualization of distribution trends using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and folium.

####Key Findings (Summary)
-Specific neighborhoods showed consistently high demand for food hampers.
-Demand correlates strongly with lower household income and higher population density.
-Some underserved areas could benefit from mobile distribution points due to distance from fixed centers.

Tools & Technologies
-Python 
-Pandas, NumPy
-Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium
-GeoPandas (if used)
-Open-source socio-economic datasets

### Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `CMPT3835Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis, visualizations, and insights.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the purpose and structure of the project.
- `Fcfm1.Auto.cleanedFood Hampers Fact_CMPT3835.csv`: Contains cleaned data used for the analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

### Getting Started

To get started with our project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. The dependencies are listed below.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium geopandas
```

Then open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
